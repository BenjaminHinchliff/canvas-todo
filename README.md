# Canvas TUI Todo List

A small tool to fetch upcoming assignments from the Canvas API.

This is still unfinished, but may still prove useful in its current state.

## Usage

Due to the fact that canvas Oauth2 client information has to be generated by administrators,
and I want this tool to be widely usable, a canvas api token has to be provided in the
environment variable `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`.

First, retrieve the api token from canvas itself, as described [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html#manual-token-generation).

Obviously, since anyone could theoretically use this token and it is unscoped, please be careful with it.

To add the environment variable, one option is a .env file containing something like:

```env
export CANVAS_API_TOKEN="[YOUR API TOKEN HERE]"
```

and save it.

Then, simply install dependencies and run the main file:

```sh
# set up a virtual environment and activate it (optional, but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# run the application
python main.py
```
